# Metis Project Proposal 2: Linear Regression

## QUESTION/NEED:

### What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?

What is the predicted gross based on opening weekend revenue?
Target: Gross (Domestic, International, Worldwide)
Features: opening weekend gross, budget, distributor, # of theaters, genre, distributor

### Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

Folks who get paid based on movie performance (staff, actors).

## DATA DESCRIPTION:

### What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?

Box Office Mojo 
https://www.boxofficemojo.com/

### What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?

Features: opening weekend gross, budget, distributor, # of theaters, genre, distributor

### If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

Target: Gross (Domestic, International, Worldwide)

## TOOLS:


### How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Beautiful Soup
- Sklearn


### Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?


I might bring in another dataset to compare movie reviews

## MVP GOAL:

### What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?

Plot of total gross vs opening gross to understand trends in movie gross.
