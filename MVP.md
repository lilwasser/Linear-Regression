### MVP

I will be examining Movie Mojo with the primary goal of creating a LR model that can predict Domestic Gross of movies, using features that indicate success. 

Features: MPAA Rating, Runtime, Opening # Theaters, Opening Gross, Domestic Gross, Worldwide Gross, Budget, Genre, Release Date, Release Season (W/S/S/F), Release Month

The MVP will be a plot of Domestic and Global Gross using sns.
